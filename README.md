# Smart-Teaching-Assistent
NLP based Smart Teaching Assistent Software

The project is based on artificial intelligence concepts. There are plenty of options available outside to learn programming. There are concepts given and one can study them. But what if any question arises in his/her mind and he want to ask it. The person needs to find some blog or some other platform where he can ask his/her question.

In this project we will be implementing Artificial Intelligence that will be able to understand the question asked by the user, analyze it, and try to generate an answer using its database. If it cannot generate the answer then it will also be able to ask the same question to the expert system that will be some another person who is really expert in that programming language. This will create a community in programming world which will be able to make them communicate in real time.

The actual motive behind this project is to make a teaching learning process more convenient for students who want to personalize their programming skills. This will provide a student to learn anytime, anywhere and without any hesitation students can get answers to any question the want to ask.
